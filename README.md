## 2. Implementation Overview

The solution is divided into three parts, covering file format handling, advanced problem-solving (Rosalind-style), and real-world application optimization.

### Part A: File Format Handling and Data Processing (35 marks)

#### Question 1: FASTA File Processing (20 marks)
Robust FASTA handlers were created:
* **Parsing:** Functions to parse FASTA files containing multiple sequences.
* **Metadata Extraction:** Logic to extract sequence headers and associated metadata.
* **Efficiency:** Implementation handles large genomic files efficiently.
* **Writing:** Capabilities for writing sequences back to a properly formatted FASTA file.

#### Question 2: Genomic Data Integration (15 marks)
A foundational data management system was developed:
* **Database Creation:** Simple data structures/databases for storing and managing sequence information.
* **Search & Retrieval:** Implementation of efficient search and retrieval functions.
* **Format Handling:** Basic functions to handle different file formats (FASTA, and basic FASTQ processing).
* **QC/Validation:** Built-in data validation and quality control measures.
